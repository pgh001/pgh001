👋 Hi, I’m @pgh001
👀 I’m interested in coding, have a mixed bag of experience from starting in BASIC to now playing with whatever attracts my eye. Most languages follow enough of a similar pattern so always willing to give it a go. Worked on in no particular order: BASIC, C, Powershell, Java, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Dataflex, DBase, Clipper, SQL, Informix 4GL, J2EE, Ruby, Javascript, probably more...
🌱 I’m currently learning Java (again)
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me!
📫 How to reach me ... https://www.linkedin.com/in/pugh001/ probably a good start.
Coming soon: (As this is new) Will start adding some little projects...
